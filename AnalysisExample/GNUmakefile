# Build script for the AnalysisExample package.

# For a standard analysis task, you probably won't need to change these lines:

LIB_TYPE    := shared
LIB         := lib$(PACKAGE)
LIBCXXFILES := $(wildcard *.cxx)
JOBFILES    := $(wildcard *.fcl)

# The SRT/LArSoft standard extensions.

include SoftRelTools/arch_spec_root.mk
include SoftRelTools/arch_spec_art.mk
include SoftRelTools/arch_spec_nutools.mk

# This line you may have to change: If you require a library in addition
# to those listed, you'd add "-l<library-name>" to the end of this line.
# For example, if you had to read in raw::RawDigit objects from an event
# record, you'd add -lRawData to the end of the line, since raw::RawDigit
# is defined in package RawData.
