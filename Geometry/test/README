This directory contains the unit tests for the Geometry service.  The tests are contained
in the GeometryTest.h(cxx) EDAnalyzer module.

To run the tests, simply execute the testgeo.csh script as follows

$./testgeo.csh <geometry_base_name>

where <geometry_base_name> is expected to be the part of the geometry file you wish
to test before the .root or .gdml extension.  The geometry file is also expected to
live in Geometry/gdml of either your private release or the publice release.

The script will configure a lar job .fcl file to use the correct geometry file and
then execute the tests.
